# Contributing to the Littlest JupyterHub Azure button

Welcome to this project and thanks  for thinking about contributing to it 🙏🏼.

To get started you  will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) and sig in. 

You'll use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) to chat in issues and pull requests on GitHub. You can think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow GitHub to render the text with formatting. For example you could write words as bold (**bold**), or in italics (*italics*), or as a link ([link](https://https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)) to another webpage.

GitHub has a helpful page on g[etting started with writing and formatting Markdown on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github)

## Share your thoughts, bugs, requests and the such

Issues are individual pieces of work that need to be completed to move the project forwards. A general guideline: if you find yourself tempted to write a great big issue that is difficult to describe as one unit of work, please consider splitting it into two or more issues.

Issues are assigned [labels](https://github.com/trallard/TLJH-azure-button/labels) which explain how they relate to the overall project's goals and immediate next steps.

### Issue labels

The current list  of labels are [here](https://github.com/trallard/TLJH-azure-button/labels) and include:

* ![Question](https://img.shields.io/badge/-question-d876e3.svg) These issues are questions and represent a great place to start. Whomever has opened the issue wants to hear from you!

    To reply, read the question and then respond in a variety of different ways:
    
    * If you want to just agree with everything you can react to the post with one of :+1: :laugh: :heart: :tada:
    * Alternatively you could write a comment to:
      * express your emotions more dramatically ****
      * provide a more nuanced description of your answer (using your words)
      * ask for a clarification
      * ask a follow up question

<br>

* ![No Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/-no%20code-602080.svg)These issues don't require any coding knowledge.
    
    If you're looking to contribute but aren't very confident in your coding skills these issues are a great place to start.
    
    All issues with the no code label are asking for feedback or suggestions.

<br>

* ![Good First Bug](https://img.shields.io/badge/-good%20first%20bug-7057ff.svg)These issues contain a task that anyone with any level of experience can help with.

<br>

* ![Help Wanted](https://img.shields.io/badge/-help%20wanted-01d28e.svg) These issues contain a task that a member of the team has determined we need additional help with.

<br>

* ![Bugs](https://img.shields.io/badge/-bugs-fc2929.svg) These issues point to problems in the project.

## Make a change

Once you've identified one of the issues above that you feel you can contribute to, you're ready to make a change to the project repository! :tada::smiley:

1. First, describe what you're planning to do as a comment to the issue, (and this might mean making a new issue).

     [This blog][link_pushpullblog] is a nice explanation of why putting this work in up front is so useful to everyone involved.
    
2. [Fork][link_fork] the [Littlest JupyterHub deploy to Azure button repo][link_repo] to your profile.

    You can now do whatever you want with this copy of the project. You won't mess up anyone else's work so you're super safe.

3. Make the changes you've discussed.

    Try to keep the changes focused rather than changing lots of things at once. If you feel tempted to branch out then please *literally* branch out: create [separate branches][link_branches] for different updates to make the next step much easier!

4. Submit a [pull request][link_pullrequest].
    
    The maintainer will review your changes, have a bit of discussion and hopefully merge them in!

**Success!!** :balloon::balloon::balloon: Well done! And thank you :smiley::tada::sparkles:


## Thank you!
